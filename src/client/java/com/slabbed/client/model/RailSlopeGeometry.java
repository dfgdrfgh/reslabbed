/**
 * Draws a straight rail on the profile {@link RailSlopeProfile} fits for it (maintainer ruling,
 * 2026-09-28).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla draws a rail as one plane: flat at 1/16, or a ramp from 1/16 to 17/16. Both are linear
 * along the rail's axis, so subtracting vanilla's rise and adding the fitted one leaves every quad
 * PLANAR — the same sprite, the same UVs, the texture stretched along the slope exactly as vanilla's
 * own ramp stretches it. No model is registered; the rail model's own quads are captured and
 * re-emitted with their vertices moved. A {@link RailSlopeProfile.Profile#kinked kinked} profile (a
 * V) is drawn as two planes: every quad is split at the middle of the cell, each half on its own
 * plane.
 *
 * <p>CAPTURE on this renderer API: a quad transform can only edit a quad in place, never turn one
 * quad into two, so the V split cannot be a transform. Instead a capturing transform is pushed
 * around the wrapped model's own emission; it copies every quad into a mesh and drops it from the
 * output. The transform stack runs the most recently pushed transform first, so each quad is
 * captured before any outer transform touches it, and those outer transforms then apply exactly
 * once, to the fitted quads re-emitted through the context's own emitter. That emitter also applies
 * the context's face culling, so nothing here bypasses it. This works for every model kind the
 * wrapper holds: the renderer routes a vanilla model's quads through the same transform stack.
 *
 * <p>The seat is applied here, once, for these quads: the caller returns straight after, before
 * pushing its own seat translate, so a vertex written here is a vertex drawn with no second shift.
 * Rail quads carry no cull face, so the step-seam cull work of the ordinary path has nothing to do
 * for them.
