/**
 * The height a placement transaction already resolved on the client, held only until the
 * authoritative fact for that cell arrives.
 *
 * <p>The client runs the same placement transaction the server does and reaches the same height,
 * then drops it, because only the server may write a fact. Its chunk mesh then falls back to the
 * live neighbourhood lane, which deliberately answers something else - the placement answer may
 * legitimately be deeper. The block therefore draws at the wrong height until the fact syncs, and
 * visibly jumps when it lands.
 *
 * <p><b>This is not a fact and must never be read as one.</b> It is consulted from exactly one
 * place, the chunk-mesh height lookup, so collision, targeting, and every interaction keep reading
 * the authoritative store and cannot be moved by a prediction. Reading it anywhere else would make
 * a guess indistinguishable from a frozen height, which is the first law's whole subject.
 *
 * <p>Entries expire on a tick deadline whether or not a fact ever arrives, because some accepted
 * placements never produce one - a refused write, or a cell the store excludes. Without the
 * deadline those entries would live forever and become exactly the fact they must not be.
 *
 * <p>An expiry changes what the mesh draws without changing any block state, so nothing in
 * vanilla would rebuild the section. Every expired cell is therefore reported to the installed
 * expiry hook, always from {@link #advanceTick()} on the ticking thread, never from a mesh worker.
