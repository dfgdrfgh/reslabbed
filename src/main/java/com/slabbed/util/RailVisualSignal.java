/**
 * A lowered rail takes redstone at the cell it is DRAWN in (maintainer ruling, 2026-09-28).
 *
 * <p>A rail seated on a slab lives one grid cell above the slab but is drawn inside the slab's
 * cell. Vanilla reads a powered rail's input from the six neighbours of its GRID cell, so a torch or
 * a wire standing beside the slab — touching the drawn rail — is a diagonal to vanilla and never
 * powers it, and an unpowered powered rail is a brake. This class names the cell the rail is drawn
 * in and reads the signals arriving at that cell, so the rail is powered by what visibly touches it.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT: this ADDS a cell the rail listens at; it never removes vanilla's own. A rail drawn in
 * its own cell (seat above -0.5) answers exactly as vanilla. The drawn cell is read exactly as
 * vanilla reads a rail's own cell — all six neighbours — so a torch under the slab a rail sits on
 * powers it the way a torch under a full block powers the rail on top.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT (LAW.md): a read of the rail's seat through {@link SlabSupport#getYOffset}, the same
 * read the rail slope profile and the render path apply, never a write.
