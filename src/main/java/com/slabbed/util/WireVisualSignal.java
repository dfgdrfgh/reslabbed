/**
 * A lowered redstone wire is read at the cell it is DRAWN in (maintainer ruling, 2026-09-28).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla wire steps up only onto a full conductor. A wire seated on a slab lives one grid cell
 * above the slab but is drawn inside the slab's cell, half a block above the wire beside the slab.
 * The slab is not a conductor, so the wire beside it looks UNDER the slab for a step down and never
 * at the wire drawn on top of it: power climbed the half-step (the lowered wire reads down past the
 * air over its lower neighbour) but never came back down. This class names the wire drawn in a
 * neighbouring cell so the wire beside it can read it, the way it would read a wire in that cell.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT: this ADDS a read; it never removes vanilla's own. A wire drawn in its own cell
 * (seat above -0.5) is never counted — including vanilla's wire on a top slab or on glowstone, whose
 * one-way step is deliberate vanilla behaviour — and a wire drawn more than a block above or below
 * the reader's own drawn height is never counted, so the reach stays vanilla's one-block step.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT (LAW.md): a read of seats through {@link SlabSupport#getYOffset}, the same read the
 * render path applies, never a write.
