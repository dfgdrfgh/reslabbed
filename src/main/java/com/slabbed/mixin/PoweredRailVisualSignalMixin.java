/**
 * A powered rail seated on a lowered block is powered by what visibly touches it (maintainer
 * ruling, 2026-09-28).
 *
 * <p>Both of vanilla's input reads are widened: the rail's own state update, and the rail-to-rail
 * chain check that asks whether a neighbouring powered rail is itself fed. Widening only the first
 * would power the lowered rail and still leave the rails chained to it dark, because the chain asks
 * the grid-cell question again on each link. On this line both chain methods share the name
 * {@code isPoweredByOtherRails}; the chain check is the overload that takes the rail shape.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT: vanilla's answer is kept and only OR-ed with the drawn-cell read; a rail drawn in its
 * own cell is unaffected. See {@link RailVisualSignal}.
