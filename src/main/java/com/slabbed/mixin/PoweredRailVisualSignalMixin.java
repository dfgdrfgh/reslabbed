/**
 * A powered rail seated on a lowered block is powered by what visibly touches it (maintainer
 * ruling, 2026-09-28).
 *
 * <p>Both of vanilla's input reads are widened: the rail's own state update, and the rail-to-rail
 * chain check that asks whether a neighbouring powered rail is itself fed. Widening only the first
 * would power the lowered rail and still leave the rails chained to it dark, because the chain asks
 * the grid-cell question again on each link.
 *
 * <p>The call is compiled against {@code Level} although {@code SignalGetter} declares it, so the
 * target names {@code Level} as its owner.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT: vanilla's answer is kept and only OR-ed with the drawn-cell read; a rail drawn in its
 * own cell is unaffected. See {@link RailVisualSignal}.
