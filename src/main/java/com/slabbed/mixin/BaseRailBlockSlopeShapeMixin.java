/**
 * A rail's outline and raycast box follow the slope it is drawn with (maintainer ruling,
 * 2026-09-28).
 *
 * <p>Vanilla sizes the box from the rail's own shape alone: 2/16 tall for a flat rail, 8/16 for a
 * full-block ramp. When {@link RailSlopeProfile} fits the rail's slope to a neighbour at a different
 * seat, the drawn rail may rise half a block above a "flat" box or stop well short of a "ramp" box,
 * so the player could not target the rail where it is drawn. The box is sized from the fitted
 * profile instead; the state mixin then moves it by the rail's seat exactly as before.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT: the box is derived from the same profile the model is drawn from, so outline,
 * raycast and drawn geometry cannot disagree. Rails carry no collision, so this changes no movement.
 *
 * <p>INVARIANT (LAW.md): a read of stored seats only; no rail's own height is written or re-derived.
