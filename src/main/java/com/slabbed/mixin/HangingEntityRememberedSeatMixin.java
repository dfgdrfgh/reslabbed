/**
 * A hung decoration REMEMBERS the height of the face it was hung on (LAW 1; maintainer ruling,
 * 2026-09-13: where it is placed is where it stays, for everything hung on a wall).
 *
 * <p>The seat is MINTED ONCE — when the decoration is first told which way it faces on the server,
 * with its support loaded, which is the moment the item hangs it — from the support's stored height, and is
 * then carried in synced entity data and in save data. Every later layout reads the remembered
 * number verbatim; nothing here re-reads the support. Rebuilding the wall behind a hung frame at a
 * different height is a change to the WALL, not to the frame (LAW 1 §3).
 *
 * <p>The entity's REAL position deliberately stays at grid height: moving it corrupts the derived
 * grid cell and {@code survives()} judges the wrong support. Only the bounding box shifts here, and
 * the render layer applies the same remembered seat to the drawing. Vanilla's {@code
 * recalculateBoundingBox} sets the position from the unshifted box first, so the shift is applied at
 * its TAIL and fires exactly once per layout for frames (whose override calls into this one) and
 * paintings alike.
 *
 * <p>A decoration saved before this seat existed carries no number; after its data is restored,
 * available chunks allow a mint from its wall, otherwise a later tick retries. That is a one-time
 * migration, not a re-derivation.
 *
 * <p>Nothing here reads the world while a decoration's data is being restored: that may run inside
 * the promotion of the very chunk it would ask for. Every chunk the mint reads is taken only if
 * already complete, never requested and waited on. With the frozen store off, the support's height
 * walks neighbouring cells through the world; those cantilever walks are bounded ({@code
 * MAX_CHAIN_DEPTH}) and can cause a bounded stall on the tick path, never a self-deadlock.
