/**
 * A hung decoration REMEMBERS the height of the face it was hung on (LAW.md Law 1; maintainer
 * ruling, 2026-09-13: where it is placed is where it stays, for everything hung on a wall).
 *
 * <p>The seat is MINTED ONCE — when the decoration is first told which way it faces on the server,
 * with its chunks ready, which is the moment the item hangs it — from the support's stored
 * height, and is then carried in synced entity data and in save data. Every later layout reads the
 * remembered number verbatim; nothing here re-reads the support. Rebuilding the wall behind a hung
 * frame at a different height is a change to the WALL, not to the frame.
 *
 * <p>The entity's REAL position deliberately stays at grid height: moving it corrupts the derived
 * grid cell and {@code survives()} judges the wrong support. Only the bounding box shifts here, and
 * the render layer applies the same remembered seat to the drawing. Vanilla's {@code
 * recalculateBoundingBox} sets the position from the unshifted box first, so the shift is applied
 * at its TAIL and fires exactly once per layout; on this version that method is final on
 * {@code HangingEntity}, so frames and paintings share it. Every layout recomputes the box from the
 * cell and the facing before the shift, so laying out again never stacks a second shift.
 *
 * <p>A decoration saved before this seat existed carries no number; after its data is restored,
 * ready chunks allow a mint from its wall, otherwise a later server tick retries. That is a
 * one-time migration, not a re-derivation.
 *
 * <p>Entity loading must never wait on a chunk. Save data may be read inside chunk promotion, where
 * a blocking chunk request for a neighbour cannot finish until the promotion running it has
 * returned. So nothing is minted while save data is read, and a mint only reads chunks that are
 * already loaded — never the chunk this loader is still promoting, whose neighbours may not be.
 *
 * <p>Two traps this shape avoids. (1) Minting DURING a layout locks onto the default facing: a
 * painting's variant is restored before its facing is, and that restore lays the box out with the
 * default SOUTH direction, so a mint there would read the wrong wall. The mint therefore hangs off
 * the facing setter (and the post-read and tick retries), never off the layout. (2) Re-laying the
 * box out when the synced value changes is CLIENT-ONLY: the server's own layout after the mint
 * already applies it.
 *
 * <p>On this version {@code HangingEntity} declares no synched-data, facing, save or data-update
 * hook of its own, and both hung classes override those without calling super. The per-class
 * mixins forward into the bridge methods below; this class stays the only implementation.
