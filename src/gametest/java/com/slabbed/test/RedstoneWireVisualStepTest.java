/**
 * A redstone wire beside a lowered half-step reads the wire drawn on the slab next to it (maintainer
 * ruling, 2026-09-28) — {@link com.slabbed.util.WireVisualSignal} and its hook in the wire evaluator.
 *
 * <p>The scene is a stone floor at row 1. The reader wire sits on stone at row 2 (wire at row 3);
 * the column beside it carries a bottom slab at row 3 with a wire at row 4 seated -0.5, drawn inside
 * the slab's cell half a block above the reader. A redstone block beside the lowered wire feeds it.
 * Seats are authored and read with the store ON, the shipped configuration, and every wire
 * premise-checks its seat. Wires are placed and then re-shaped from their surroundings, the way
 * placement does in play, so connection arms are the game's own answer. The reader's arm toward the
 * slab IS vanilla's own answer: a bottom slab's top counts as a surface a wire can stand on, so the
 * wire beside it already connected toward the slab — only the power read was missing. The arm rows
 * pin that no connection hook is needed on this line; a port whose slab top is not such a surface
 * must add one.
 *
 * <p>MUTATIONS that must redden this class: withhold {@code RedstoneWireEvaluatorVisualStepMixin}
 * (rows 1, 4, 5, 7, 8); drop the drawn-cell test in {@code WireVisualSignal.wireDrawnIn} (row 2,
 * the top-slab control); drop its one-block bound (row 9).
